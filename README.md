# Weak Closure Pattern

### It is a weak closure implementation for .NET

Creation of the closure behavior that will not be dependent from any .NET compiler.

**Sorry, it is under development and this project is personally for me**

**This project requires the [Weak Delegate](https://github.com/it3xl/WeakDelegate) project.**


```cs
weakClosure.ExecuteIfTargetNotNull(objectSupplier =>
	{
		...
```
